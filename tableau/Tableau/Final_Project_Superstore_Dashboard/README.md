# Final Tableau Project — SaaS Revenue Metrics Dashboard

This project represents a full end-to-end analytical solution for evaluating revenue performance of a SaaS product.  
The complete workflow covers data extraction and modeling in SQL, followed by in-depth visual analysis in Tableau.

The dashboard provides a structured view of revenue dynamics, user behavior, and monetisation efficiency, allowing product and business teams to make informed strategic decisions.

## 🎯 Goal

To create a comprehensive SaaS revenue analytics dashboard that enables deep analysis of financial performance, user monetisation patterns, and growth sustainability.

The project focuses on:
- Tracking core SaaS metrics such as MRR, Paid Users, and ARPPU  
- Understanding revenue composition through Growth Drivers (New, Expansion, Contraction, Churn)  
- Evaluating customer lifetime value and retention behavior  
- Detecting seasonal revenue patterns and behavioural trends  
- Comparing performance across demographic segments (age groups and language)

The primary objective is to transform complex revenue data into an intuitive, decision-ready analytical tool.

## 📊 Key Insights

- Expansion MRR proved to be the strongest contributor to overall revenue growth  
- User churn increased notably during autumn, affecting net retention rates  
- Revenue churn remained comparatively low, indicating that mainly low-value users churn first  
- LT and LTV metrics showed pronounced seasonality  
- ARPPU varied significantly between demographic segments, highlighting monetisation differences
